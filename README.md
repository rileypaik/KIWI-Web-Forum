## Problems KIWI Solves
- PROBLEM 1: Employees need to have their question reach their desired audience.
- SOLUTION 1: The forum is organized by a specialization tags system. Each question can have one or more specialization tags attached, so company employees who are specialized in that tag can be notified when the question is posted. This helps employees avoid having to ask the same question in different Slack channels and sending out massive disruptive group emails to ensure their question reaches their desired audience.

- PROBLEM 2: Questions that have already been answered are getting lost in different Slack channels.
- SOLUTION 2: KIWI has an archive containing all of the company’s previous questions and answers and can be easily searched through using KIWI’s keyword and specialization tag filtering system. This helps employees avoid spending time on issues that have already been solved in the past.

- PROBLEM 3: Employees are out of work
- SOLUTION 3: Employees can create a post with the “work-needed” tag attached to notify other employees who need help that they are available. This helps avoid downtime and allows employees to reach their chargeable hours goals.
